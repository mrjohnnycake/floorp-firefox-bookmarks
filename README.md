## Thanks to
Thanks go to Denis Gerber since his extension [ulauncher-firefox-bookmarks](https://github.com/KuenzelIT/ulauncher-firefox-bookmarks) was the base for this one. In turn, thanks also go out to Riccardo Massidda for his extension [ulauncher-firefox-history](https://github.com/rmassidda/ulauncher-firefox-history) as it was the base for Denis Gerber's extension. Since my programming skills are mediocre at best I couldn't have made this without both of them doing the heavy lifting.
